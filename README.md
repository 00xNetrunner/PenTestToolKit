## Description
PyMAP is created to automate the process of network scanning through a simple, easy-to-use script. It leverages the power of `nmap` to conduct scans on specified IP addresses, examining a wide range of TCP and UDP ports. The script performs OS detection, version scanning, and banner grabbing to provide a comprehensive overview of the network status. The scan results are neatly organized into text files, making it easy for users to review and analyze the information.

## Usage
To use PyMAP, follow the steps below:
1. Download the `PyMAP.py` file from the repository.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `PyMAP.py` file.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 PyMAP.py
   ```
