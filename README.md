PyMAP is a compact yet powerful script designed for conducting network scanning to gather valuable information about the devices on your network. Utilizing the robustness of `nmap`, PyMAP automates the process of scanning both TCP and UDP ports, alongside performing OS detection, version scanning, and banner grabbing across multiple IP addresses. The script outputs the scan results into organized text files for easy analysis and future reference.

## Description
PyMAP is created to automate the process of network scanning through a simple, easy-to-use script. It leverages the power of `nmap` to conduct scans on specified IP addresses, examining a wide range of TCP and UDP ports. The script performs OS detection, version scanning, and banner grabbing to provide a comprehensive overview of the network status. The scan results are neatly organized into text files, making it easy for users to review and analyze the information.

## Usage
To use PyMAP, follow the steps below:
1. Download the `PyMAP.py` file from the repository.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `PyMAP.py` file.
4. Run the following command:
